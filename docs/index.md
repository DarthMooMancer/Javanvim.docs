# Welcome to Javanvim
----------

### What is Javanvim?
Javanvim is a simple plugin that gives neovim some nice functions while being extremely extensible for Java developers. Are there better plugins? Most likely, however this has simple functions for:

* Creating New Projects
* Creating New Files (With Class Generation)
* Building Files (Currently only Main.java files)
* Running Files (Again only Main.java files)

## Migrate
I added a function that migrates the root/src and root/out to the new src and build folder layout. Not a very useful command, unless you made a lot of projects and don't want to manually move everything around. This mainly applies before March 6, 2025.
